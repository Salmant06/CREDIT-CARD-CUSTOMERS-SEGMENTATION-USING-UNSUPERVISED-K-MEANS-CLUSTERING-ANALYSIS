# CREDIT-CARD-CUSTOMERS-SEGMENTATION-USING-UNSUPERVISED-K-MEANS-CLUSTERING-ANALYSIS

Problem Definition:
This system aims to segment credit card customers based on their spending behavior and financial activities. By utilizing K-Means Clustering, we identify distinct customer groups to help banks and financial institutions tailor personalized offers, improve customer service, and reduce churn. The system analyzes transaction features such as balance, purchases, cash advances, credit limits, and payments to categorize customers effectively.

Use Cases:
 #Customer Segmentation for Targeted Marketing: Identify customer groups with similar spending behavior to offer personalized credit card promotions and rewards.
 #Risk Management & Credit Limit Adjustments: Banks can assess customer risk levels and optimize credit limit assignments.
 #Customer Retention Strategies: Helps in detecting high-value customers and those likely to churn, allowing proactive engagement.
 #Spending Pattern Analysis: Provides insights into customer spending habits to improve financial product recommendations.

Expected Outcome:
 #Customers are grouped into meaningful segments based on their spending behavior.
 #Financial institutions can tailor marketing strategies, offers, and risk management policies.
 #Provides visual insights into customer behavior using clustering techniques.

Libraries Used:
 #Pandas – Data manipulation and cleaning
 #NumPy – Numerical computations
 #Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization
 #Scikit-learn – Machine learning models (K-Means, StandardScaler)
 #Yellowbrick – Cluster evaluation (Elbow method, Silhouette analysis)

Features of the System:
 #Data Preprocessing & Cleaning: Handles missing values and standardizes numerical data.
 #Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Provides descriptive statistics, correlation heatmaps, and pair plots.
 #K-Means Clustering: Groups customers into segments based on financial activities.
 #Optimal Cluster Selection: Uses Elbow Method and Silhouette Score to determine the best number of clusters.
 #Cluster Visualization: Scatter plots and pair plots to interpret clustering results.
 #Business Insights: Derives meaningful customer insights for decision-making.

Conclusion: This customer segmentation system helps banks understand customer spending patterns, optimize marketing strategies, and enhance risk management. Using K-Means Clustering, it provides data-driven insights into different customer segments, allowing businesses to make informed decisions and improve customer engagement.
